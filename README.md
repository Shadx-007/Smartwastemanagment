## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-waste-segregation.git
cd smart-waste-segregation

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Start the development server

npm run dev

The app should now be running on: http://localhost:3000


---

🔧 Backend & AI Setup (Optional)

If you want to run the AI model locally:

1. Set up Python environment

cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start Flask API

python app.py

This will launch the image classification API on localhost:5000.

> 📦 For deployment, consider hosting this API on Render, Railway, or AWS Lambda.
